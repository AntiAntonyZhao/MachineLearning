# Applied Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a series of projects completed as part of the COMP 551 Applied Machine Learning course at McGill University. Each project focuses on different machine learning techniques and models, providing hands-on experience in implementing and understanding key concepts in the field.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Linear Regression and Logistic Regression with gradient descent
#### **Key Concepts**: Regression analysis, classification, gradient descent.
#### **Datasets**:
- Boston Housing dataset: Comprises 506 data samples with 13 real attributes (excluding 'B' due to ethical concerns). The target is the median value of owner-occupied homes.
- Wine dataset: Consists of 178 data samples with 13 attributes, distributed across three classes.
#### **Models**:
- Implement analytical linear regression for the Boston Housing dataset.
- Implement logistic regression with gradient descent for the Wine dataset.
- Implement mini-batch stochastic gradient descent for both models.
#### **Experiments**:
- Perform 80/20 train/test splits and report performance metrics.
- Use 5-fold cross-validation for performance metrics.
- Experiment with training data sizes and minibatch sizes to observe performance impacts.
- Test linear and logistic regression with different learning rates and parameter configurations.
- Utilize Gaussian basis functions for Dataset 1 and compare results with the original feature set.
- Explore mini-batch stochastic gradient descent vs analytical solutions.

### 2. Multilayer Perceptron & Convolutional Neural Network (MLP & CNN)
- **Objective**: Develop MLP and CNN models for complex image data analysis.
- **Key Concepts**: Neural network architecture, deep learning, image recognition.

### 3. Naive Bayes & BERT Models
- **Objective**: Explore text classification using Naive Bayes and delve into advanced language processing with BERT.
- **Key Concepts**: Text classification, natural language processing, transformer models.

### 4. Paper Re-implementation: Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting
- **Objective**: Re-implement the "dropout" technique of the research paper and examine its effects on model performance for part of datasets mentioned in the paper.
- **Key Concepts**: Model generalization, research analysis, regularization.
