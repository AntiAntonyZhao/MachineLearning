# Project Title: [Mini_Project_4]

## Packages Used
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: For plotting graphs and visualizations.
- `tqdm`: For progress bars during long running operations.
- `torch`: PyTorch, for building and training neural network models.
- `torch.nn`, `torch.nn.functional`, `torch.optim`: PyTorch submodules for neural network layers, functions, and optimizers.
- `torchvision`: For handling image data, transformations, and datasets.
- `torch.utils.data`: For data loading utilities like DataLoader, Subset, and random_split.

## Custom Components
- CustomDropout class: Implementation of a custom dropout layer in PyTorch.
- Neural Network Models: Two neural network architectures are defined for the experiments.
